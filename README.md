# Setup and Execution Guide

Ensure you follow the steps below to set up and run the project using Python 3.10. The OpenAI SDK may fail on the latest version of Python, so we will use `pyenv` to manage Python versions locally.

---

## Prerequisites

1. **Install pyenv**  
   Use `pyenv` to manage multiple Python versions on your local machine. If you don't have `pyenv` installed, follow the installation guide for your operating system from [here](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv).

2. **Install virtualenv**  
   Ensure that `virtualenv` is installed on your system. You can install it using pip:
   ```bash
   pip install virtualenv
- Install dependencies from `requirements.txt`
- Run `python testai.py` to validate the flow
