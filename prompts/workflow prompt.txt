Context:
you are an expert in python, langchain , langflow ecosystem and capable of building complex AI agents using langflow with customisng the code wherever needed to build a production ready langflow agent orchestrating multiple agents each with different standard langflow tools and custom tools.

Ask:
You are tasked with analysing the below flow and come up with a plan to solve this using your knowledge above to build AI agent.

Problem:
Trigger for the agent will be manual to start with
    After a loan is ready for assessment, user invokes the agent from browser to do his tasks on his behalf
Agent should perform the following
    Fetch all tasks for the user from GET tasks api
    For each task:
            Categorise the task into one of the following categories
                If task is related to fact checking something that is displayed on UI
                    Categorise it as Fact Check
                    All UI related checks and comparison
                        Ex: have all credit filter rules passed
                        This should not be done as a DB check, agent has to verify as an end user either by crawling HTML or interpreting the API response
                If task is related to document obtained and verified
                    Categorise it as OCR
                    Extract document data and compare
                        Identify the document category mentioned in the task
                        Intelligently figure out the matching documents in platform
                        Do doc search
                        Extract and compare
                If task is failing under below rules
                    Categorise as IGNORED
                    Rules:
                    Tasks falling under this are:
                    related to physical visit and verify 
                    Related to verifying some system within the bank, which agent cant access to
        Distribute the categorised task to one of Fact Check / OCR / IGNORE agents
        Fact Check Agent:
            Should check if the mentioned fact is present in the HTML
        OCR Agent
            SHould identify the mentioned document
            Fethc the documents S3 link available in the HTML
            Extract the name, address, DOB, image and signature from the document
            Compare it against the corresponding data in the HTML 
            Break the OCR agent into smaller agents as the documents to handle fall under different category:
                1. Driving license/voter id/ aadhar 
                    - these documents will have id number, name , image, dob and address. These are considered as address proof. These are indian documents and varies slightly based on the state
                2. PAn 
                    - contains name, image and dob. Considered as Identity proof. This is consistent for entire india
                3. Other documents include Bank statement, ITR, GST, agreement, tittle deed
                    - These are indian documents and will contain mostly name, one of the address proof id numbers and signature. These may run into few pages and its important to extract the signature
        IGNORE Agent
            Maintain the list of tasks that are ignored
            Agent should list the tasks ignored at the end for the end user to act on
    Mark the tasks as done by triggering tasks API for successful completion
Summarise to the user what tasks are done vs ignored

Let's break down the solution using LangFlow and LangChain ecosystem:

Main Orchestrator Agent Flow:
from langflow import Component, Agent, Tool
from typing import List, Dict

class TaskOrchestrator(Component):
    def build(self) -> Agent:
        agent = Agent(
            tools=[
                FetchTasksTool(),
                TaskClassifierTool(),
                TaskRouterTool(),
                MarkTaskCompleteTool(),
                SummaryGeneratorTool()
            ],
            memory=True
        )
        return agent

Core Components:
a) Task Classification Tool:

class TaskClassifierTool(Tool):
    def classify_task(self, task_description: str) -> str:
        from langchain.llms import OpenAI
        from langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate
        
        classifier_prompt = """Categorize the task into [FactCheck|OCR|IGNORE]:
        Rules:
        - FactCheck: UI verification, HTML/API checks
        - OCR: Document processing, data extraction
        - IGNORE: Physical verification, internal systems
        
        Task: {task}
        Category:"""
        
        llm = OpenAI(temperature=0)
        return llm(PromptTemplate.from_template(classifier_prompt).format(task=task_description))

b) Specialized Agents:

FactCheck Agent:

class FactCheckAgent(Component):
    def build(self) -> Agent:
        return Agent(
            tools=[
                UIInspectorTool(),
                APICheckerTool(),
                ComparisonEngineTool()
            ],
            system_message="You are an expert in UI fact verification"
        )

OCR Agent:

class OCRAgent(Component):
    def build(self) -> Agent:
        return Agent(
            tools=[
                DocumentIdentifierTool(),
                S3DownloadTool(),
                OCRProcessorTool(),
                DataComparisonTool()
            ],
            system_message="Expert in document processing and data extraction"
        )

c) Key Custom Tools:

UI Inspector Tool:

class UIInspectorTool(Tool):
    def check_ui_element(self, html_content: str, element_id: str) -> bool:
        from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
        soup = BeautifulSoup(html_content, 'html.parser')
        return bool(soup.find(id=element_id))

OCR Processor Tool:

class OCRProcessorTool(Tool):
    def extract_data(self, document_path: str) -> Dict:
        import pytesseract
        from PIL import Image
        
        img = Image.open(document_path)
        text = pytesseract.image_to_string(img)
        return self.parse_ocr_data(text)

Flow Integration:
def main_flow():
    orchestrator = TaskOrchestrator().build()
    
    tasks = orchestrator.use_tool("FetchTasksTool", {})
    
    results = {"completed": [], "ignored": []}
    
    for task in tasks:
        category = orchestrator.use_tool("TaskClassifierTool", {"task_description": task["description"]})
        
        if category == "FactCheck":
            result = FactCheckAgent().run({"html": task["content"], "requirements": task["checks"]})
        elif category == "OCR":
            result = OCRAgent().run({"document_task": task})
        else:
            results["ignored"].append(task)
            continue
            
        if result["success"]:
            orchestrator.use_tool("MarkTaskCompleteTool", {"task_id": task["id"]})
            results["completed"].append(task)
    
    summary = orchestrator.use_tool("SummaryGeneratorTool", results)
    return summary

Deployment Considerations:
Use LangFlow's visual interface to connect components
Add error handling for API failures
Implement retry mechanisms for OCR processing
Add validation layers for data comparison
Include async processing for parallel task handling
Add logging and monitoring hooks
Security Enhancements:
class SecureAPITool(Tool):
    def __init__(self):
        self.session = requests.Session()
        self.session.headers.update({
            "Authorization": f"Bearer {os.getenv('API_TOKEN')}",
            "Content-Encryption": "AES-256"
        })

Performance Optimization:
Implement caching for frequent UI checks
Use connection pooling for S3 access
Add document processing queue
Implement binary tree search for document matching
This architecture provides:

Clear task categorization through LLM classification
Specialized agents for different task types
Secure API integrations
End-to-end processing with audit trails
User-friendly summary output
